# Taking PlantUML Integration in Confluence to the Next Level

If you're a fan of PlantUML and using it to document diagrams and processes in Confluence, you'll love the "PlantUML SVG for Confluence" app by Grovr. This app turbocharged PlantUML integration right within the Confluence editor, making it easier than ever to create and work with diagrams.

## Write PlantUML, See SVG: The Seamless Experience 

With the PlantUML SVG app installed, simply open a page, use the `/plantuml` slash command, and start writing out your diagram code:

```plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml
```
